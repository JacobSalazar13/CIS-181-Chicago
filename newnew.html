            <p align="center"> If you are looking for some of the best burgers that just so happen to be on the best type of bread, hawaiian bread, 
				then you HAVE to check out this Lincoln Park staple! They are the perfect blend of flavorful and filling! Not just the burgers	
				but if you are more of a hot dog or chicken sandwhich person, these are also on hawaiian bread! Most importantly,
				these are halal too!! What a steal. </p>

            <p align="center"> I am the type of person who loves wings and this place by far has the best bar wings that I have tried!
				I really like going to new places to try different wings since I am on the hunt for the best ones. These for sure
				made it to the top of my list just trailing a bar that closed during COVID called Hops and Barley. This is in the Norridge area, so 
				if you are ever around and want great food and good vibes, check this out. </p>

            <p align="center"> I am learning to love middle eastern foods! They are so full of flavor and just different than other foods that
					I usually eat! I love trying new places and this is one of my newest top favorites of the year so far. Great food and great people. 
					We met the kitchen staff and they are very grateful of everyone who comes to support them. Great environment and great foods.</p>

            <img src="salt.jpg" alt="nest" width="100" class="center">>
            <p align="center"> THE. BEST. BURGER. This is known to be compared to In n Out but since we dont have that here, when I took my recent trip
				to Vegas, I had to try! Salt is so so much better and should not be compared at all to eachother. It is flavorful and just cooked perfectly. 
				The fries are just as good too! I love the sauces they have. There is a connected place for deserts too inside of this resturaunt. Great energy and 
				a Wicker Park staple. </p>

            <p align="center"> Pizza is one of my favorite foods so I really believe I know the best spots for it. If you are from Chicago
				you know about Pequods. They are everyones favorte neighborhood pizza place. They have been around for so long and everyone
				person I know says they love coming here and just couldnt imagine growing up without it. For sure one of those spots you 
				MUST try while living here or even if you have people visiting. </p>
