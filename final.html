		<p1 style="font-size:25px;">Chicago may be renowned as the birthplace of deep-dish pizza, the blues, and contemporary design.

Nevertheless, a center for world dance? The clubs and streets of the city were the birthplaces of many well-known dances. The hops, skips, turns, and twists were everywhere in the metropolis.

	<p style="font-size:20px;"><b>When and where it was developed:</b> West Division Street, sometimes known as "Polish Broadway," during the 1950s.</p>

<p style="font-size:20px;"><b>Type:</b> An Eastern-style polka that has been slowed down and made more buoyant. </p>

<p style="font-size:20px;"><b>Origin:</b> After World War II, the polka bars along Division Street, then known as "Polish Broadway," saw the emergence of Chicago's polka hop (some refer to it as the polka bounce).

The dance is often associated with Chicago polka star “Li’l Wally” Jagiello, who developed a Chicago sound in the 1950s that was noticeably slower than the speedy dominant Eastern-Style of the time.

Legend has it that Jagiello slowed down his music as a way to keep patrons in polka taverns drinking and dancing longer. The slower music also allowed couples extra time between beats to throw in a little hop, which would become known as Chicago’s polka hop. Today, couples dance the polka hop from coast to coast. In Chicago, it’s often played and danced at banquet halls in the city’s southwest suburbs.

	<p style="font-size:20px;"><b>When and ehere it was developed:</b>In the late ’60s to early ’70s on Chicago’s South Side.</p>
	<p style="font-size:20px;"><b>Style:</b> A jazzy twist on ballroom dancing named for the way couples appear to be walking, or “steppin’,” across the dance floor.</p>
	<p style="font-size:20px;"><b>Origin:</b> DJ Sam Chatman says Steppin’ evolved from a different Chicago dance style called “the Bop” that was popular in the ’50s and early ’60s. The Bop was a couples dance in which dancers slid and glided across the dance floor, ballroom style.
Steppin’ is an outgrowth of “the Bop” but with extra twists and turns. Chatman says accompanying music for the dance can range from R&B to country, but it needs to have a romantic theme. Steppin’ is now danced around the country at parties known as “steppers sets.” In Chicago, dancers come out for steppers sets each week at clubs like The 50 Yard Line in the South Side’s Chatham neighborhood.</P>

	<p style="font-size:20px;"><b>When and where it was invented:</b>On Chicago's South and West sides in the late 1980s</p>
	<p style="font-size:20px;"><b>Style:</b> a competitive dance form with incredibly quick kicks, steps, twists, and turns that is sometimes done as part of a Footwork "battle."</p>
	<p style="font-size:20px;"><b>Origin</b>House-music dance groups from the South Side of Chicago in the 1980s, such House-O-Matic, were motivated by avant-garde solo maneuvers popular on the West Side, particularly the "Holy Ghost." The performers of "Holy Ghost" made jerky gestures that resembled those of believers who are filled with the Holy Spirit during church services.

The dance was altered by House-O-Matic by including side-to-side motions. Footwork fight music was created by RP Boo in the 1990s. Following its appearance in the 2007 music video for "Watch My Feet" by Dude 'n Nem, the dance move gained popularity outside of Chicago.</p>
	<h2 style="font-size:30px;">Cha-Cha Slide</h2>

	<p style="font-size:20px;"><b>When and where it was invented:</b>In the late ’90s in Chicago’s Englewood neighborhood.</p>
	<p style="font-size:20px;"><b>Style:</b>A-line dance in which participants follow the song's instructions, commonly known as "The Cha-Cha Slide," in which they are told to step, slide, stomp, cross their legs, and perform a small amount of cha-cha.</p>
	<p style="font-size:20px;"><b>Origin:</b>Willie Perry Jr., nicknamed DJ Casper, claims that he originally created "The Cha-Cha Slide" as a step aerobics exercise for his nephew, a Bally's Total Fitness personal trainer. He claimed that he received requests to play the song at nearby dance clubs and parties quite rapidly.

The song was chosen by Chicago's WGCI-FM radio station in 2000, and ultimately Universal Records. It has developed into a global phenomenon that jams dance floors at events like weddings and bar mitzvahs.</p>
